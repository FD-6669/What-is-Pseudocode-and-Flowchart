Flowchart

    What is a flowchart? The flowchart is a diagram that shows step by step a process, system, or computer algorithm. The early purpose of flowchart was a tool for computer 
science that used to represent algorithms and programming logic but it had extended to use in other kinds of processes or procedures. It comes with a graphical interface which 
gives a better view. Now, flowchart plays an important role in multiple fields to plan, study, communicate often complex procedures in clear, easy-to-understand pictures. In 
simple terms, flowchart plays an extremely important role in showing or displaying information. There are many kinds of shapes such as rectangle, oval, diamonds are connected 
in the flowchart along with connecting arrows to represent the flow and sequence of a process or operation. It has different conventional meanings for each different flowchart 
shape. For example, the terminator symbol or known as the oval shape is used to represent the starting and ending point of the process in a flowchart. The flowchart can be 
created from simple, hand-drawn charts or using a computer to make computer-drawn diagrams depicting flows or multiple steps of processes. The flowchart is the most common 
diagram in the world used by both technical and non-technical people. The history of flowchart comes from the industrial engineers called Frank and Lilian Gilbreth where they 
introduced the “Flow Process Chart” to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). Since the flowchart was introduced, it is also called as Process Flowchart, Process 
Flow Diagram (PFD), Process Map, Functional Flowchart, and Business Process Mapping. In programming, pseudocode is used to assist in creating a flowchart because pseudocode is 
a method of describing computer algorithms in texts. We can convert pseudocode into a flowchart to make it more understandable by others.
